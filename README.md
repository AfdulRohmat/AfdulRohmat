Hello, I'm Afdul Rohmat, a passionate software developer with a relentless drive for learning and innovation. My journey in the world of software development has been marked by a diverse range of experiences, from freelancing to part-time gigs, and now as a full-time software developer at PT Traspac Makmur Sejahtera.

My love for technology and software development is at the core of my identity. I thrive on the challenges and possibilities that the tech world offers. I specialize in a wide array of technologies, with a primary focus on :
- Laravel
- Nuxt.js 
- Flutter
which I use daily to craft remarkable digital experiences. These technologies have become my trusted tools for building robust, efficient, and user-friendly software.

In addition to my core expertise, I also have an intermediate-level proficiency with 
- Node.js,

- Kotlin Jetpack Compose,
- and Next.js 13.
- This diversity in my skill set allows me to adapt to different project requirements and explore new horizons in software development.

I believe that software development is not just a job; it's a thrilling journey of constant learning and problem-solving. It's about transforming ideas into reality and making a positive impact on the world. I'm committed to this journey, and I'm excited to share my experiences, knowledge, and projects with the GitHub community.
